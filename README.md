## Overview
This demo project is a decentralized soccer prediction market platform built on the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**. This monorepo contains all core components needed to operate the system, including smart contracts, a web frontend, a backend server, and a subgraph.

A **Mock USDC** faucet is provided. This faucet dispenses mUSDC (test tokens) for use on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet, ensuring you can seamlessly test the prediction markets without needing real USDC.

## Technologies
- **Solidity** – Core logic for the prediction markets via smart contracts.
- **Chainlink Functions** – Acts as an Oracle for match result retrieval from API Football.
- **Chainlink Automation** – Executes smart contract actions (e.g., match resolution) automatically.
- **Gnosis Conditional Tokens Framework (CTF)** – Enables conditional payouts based on match outcomes.
- **Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)** – Dynamically calculates odds and manages liquidity.
- **The Graph Protocol** – Indexes on-chain events and provides efficient querying.
- **React** + **RainbowKit** – Delivers a user-friendly web interface and WalletConnect integration.
- **Express.js** + **WebSockets** – Handles backend data aggregation and enables real-time odds updates.
